# ‚ö°‚öôÔ∏è My Productivity Extensions

This is a curated collection of custom-built and community-sourced extensions/plugins for Chrome, VSCode, Obsidian, and Raycast that I use every day for a lean and powerful productivity workflow.

Over time, I‚Äôve tried countless tools and these are the essentials that stood the test of time.

## To Build or Not to Build?

In most cases, you'll find that community-built extensions cover a wide range of common workflows for mature applications. However, if your needs are highly specific, building or customizing an extension might be the best option.

### When Should You Build?

- **Niche Use Cases:**
  For example, many community AI extensions defaults to only support OpenAI API endpoints. This is a great opportunity to contribute to the community by supporting other APIs or self-hosted solutions. This trend also applies to other areas such as xloud providers, where many extensions are built for AWS APIs.

- **Learning Opportunities:**
  Building an extension is a fantastic way to learn new frameworks, APIs, and publishing processes. Who knows, you might open a new path from there?

- **Last-Mile Customization:**
  Community tools are often designed for a broad audience and can sometimes be bloated with 'unnecessary' features that you don't use. For example, I generally only use one or two key features from an extension, and I have a strong preference to access these features via keyboard shortcuts. _This is often the driving reason for me to build my own tools to adapt these tools to my workflow and not the other way around._

## üåê Chrome

Chrome is my go-to choice for web browsing, and most of my shortcut keys can be achieved with [davzoku/awesome-custom-search-engines](https://github.com/davzoku/awesome-custom-search-engines). The extensions are mainly to add more shortcuts or for diagnostic purposes such as analyze a website's performance and tech stack.

## ‚ô¶Ô∏è Raycast

Raycast has emerged as my go-to productivity tool, replacing Alfred and Spotlight. It offers a powerful command palette that allows me to quickly access resources the way I prefer. With built-in features like clipboard history, Focus Session, and Quicklinks, Raycast helps me stay in flow and minimize context switching throughout the day.

I use [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) and [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) for Hyperkey setup as I use a more advanced combination of `HyperKey` and `HyperShiftKey` in my workflow. Refer to [davzoku/dotfiles](https://github.com/davzoku/dotfiles/blob/master/macos-base/hammerspoon-app/base-init.lua) for more details.
